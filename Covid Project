/*
  COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

  This set of SQL queries is part of my COVID-19 data analysis project, designed to showcase
  my skills in data retrieval, manipulation, and analysis. The queries provided here are
  specifically tailored to extract relevant information from the dataset for further analysis.

  Project Overview:
  - Objective: Analyze COVID-19 data to derive insights into infection rates, geographical
               trends, and other key metrics.
  - Tools Used: SQL for data querying and analysis.

  Feel free to explore the queries below to gain insights into my
  approach and methodology.
